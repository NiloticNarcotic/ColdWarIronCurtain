 SWE_The_Hajen_Class_Submarine:0 "Hajen III-klass Submarines"
 SWE_The_Hajen_Class_Submarine_desc:0 "At the end of World War II, the Swedish Navy noted that the design of the country's submarines had lagged behind and become obsolete with the new submarines, especially types XXI and XXIII, introduced by Kriegsmarine at the end of the war. The victorious allies jealously protected the submarine information they had obtained, and neutral Sweden thus had no access to new innovations. Fortunately, at the end of the war, on 8 May 1945, the newly completed German Navy Type XXI submarine U-3503 was submerged in Swedish territorial waters off Gothenburg, thus giving the Swedish a chance to investigate the new technology."

 SWE_NUKES.1.d:0 "Debate is raging within the Swedish cabinet regarding a recommendation from the Defense Ministry that Sweden must acquire nuclear weapons to preserve its neutrality and independence. The minister believes the deteriorating international situation and rapid expansion of nuclear arsenals by the Soviet Union and United States makes nuclear weapons an essential deterrent. However, a coalition partner, the Federation of Social Democratic Women (SSKF) strongly opposes the recommendation. They argue such weapons would militarize Sweden and raise the risk of conflict and protested the decision by the cabinet to keep these discussions away from the public. The government must decide to either risk opposition and public backlash by going nuclear, or risk leaving Sweden defenseless to nuclear blackmail and giving in to the SSKF." 
 SWE_NATO.1.d:0 "The government of Sweden reached out with a proposal regarding their current position of neutrality. Sweden has offered to join NATO in exchange for the right to purchase nuclear weapons from the United States. Bringing Sweden into NATO could add a new, modern, militarily potent frontline state against the Soviet Union. We would also gain greater capabilities to counter Soviet threats in the Baltic. However, some in the State Department and Pentagon express misgivings with the proposal, stating the spread of nuclear technology and weapons in this way reduces international control and ultimately risks American interests. The White House must decide if it will accept the proliferation of nuclear weapons to Sweden for its alliance or adopt a firm non-proliferation stance."
 SWE_NATO.2.d:0 "The United States government accepted our proposal for joining NATO in exchange for American nuclear weapons. The Defense Ministry and military are overjoyed by the news. The current nuclear program is quite dependent on American cooperation and their complete support will enable the creation of a robust nuclear deterrence. Although Sweden finally achieved its goal of deterrence, it comes at the cost of neutrality. Many Swedes will likely be concerned and oppose our decision. We will monitor the reaction of the Soviet Union closely, its leadership has long warned any expansion of NATO to Sweden would incur a major response." 
 SWE_NATO.3.d:0 "The United States government declined our proposal for joining NATO in exchange for American nuclear weapons. This is a major disappointment for the Defense Ministry and military who have long advocated the acquiring of a nuclear deterrence. However, it appears the United States is committed towards non-proliferation, even at the cost of losing potential military allies. Although an agreement was not reached, some in the government will be happy that Swedish neutrality remains in place."
 SWE_NATO.4.d:0 "The ambassador in Stockholm confirmed reports that Sweden plans on joining NATO. This is an unacceptable shift in the European balance. Sweden borders the Soviet Union, giving the American alliance access to intercept Soviet shipping and striking deep into Soviet land. NATO will also gain access to the defense industry and military power of Sweden, shifting the balance of power. To restore this balance, there is a proposal to seize the strategic island of Svalbard, administered by Norway but home to a large Soviet population and mines. Controlling it would be key to ensuring NATO cannot easily blockade our shipping. We must decide whether to initiate the plan, risking an escalation with NATO, or just focus on diplomatic condemnations."
 SWE.5.d:0 "Since the 1930s, the Swedish government has sought to implement the political concept of "The Peoples Home." The root belief is that society should function as a family unit, with its members contributing and looking after one another. It offers a balanced approach between capitalism and socialism. Total nationalization or privatization does not exist, instead the government relies on regulations over direct control of the economy. Class struggle is replaced with class collaboration for the national good. The Swedish government has announced plans to launch new welfare programs and expand existing programs to better serve the people."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.5.d:0  "The Swedish government wholly supports the Atoms for Peace initiative. Nuclear technology presents a major opportunity for Sweden to meet its energy needs and fuel economic growth. The United States initiative offers an opportunity for all nations to reap the benefits of nuclear technology and shows the peaceful intentions of the United States. Swedish nuclear researchers are eagerly seeking awaiting the opportunity to engage directly with American experts to rapidly bring nuclear energy to the people."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.1.d:0 "The Swedish government sent a request to enhance cooperation in the field of nuclear energy. The Swedish state began pursuing nuclear research as early as 1946. With our help, they hope to utilize nuclear energy to fuel economic development and energy independence. On paper, such an agreement would likely provide a boost in our own research as Sweden has top notch researchers. However, intelligence reports indicate many Swedish officials believe in a nuclear deterrence and the knowledge they gain from us could accelerate a clandestine weapons program. We can either accept the deal and trust the Swedes stay committed to energy development, or reject it because the risks are too high."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.2.d:0 "The United States accepted our proposal for enhanced nuclear energy cooperation. This will bring a wealth of information and more importantly, access to blueprints and essential materials for a nuclear energy program. Increased scientific connections can also allow our scientists to hone and test their own theories on developing such technology. The government is hopeful for a more rapid expansion of nuclear energy to the country. Privately, some security officials believe expanding these facilities could offer long-term benefits for nuclear weapons development, if needed."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.3.d:0 "The United States rejected our proposal for enhanced nuclear energy cooperation. This is a major setback for our plans to bring nuclear energy to Sweden rapidly. We estimate that nuclear energy represents the possibility of meeting energy demands and supporting economic growth. The American government stated it could not engage with such an agreement due to its current commitments. However, it appears the United States were worried that the exchange of knowledge and materials may instead be used for a nuclear weapons program, this despite our insistence we just want to work with them on developing nuclear energy."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.20.d:0 "The top nuclear research scientists and planners sent a report to the government on the steps necessary for a domestic nuclear fuel cycle. This covers how to acquire the necessary materials, what facilities need to be established, and what steps need to occur for Sweden to produce its own energy from nuclear technology. The ambitious plan requires the cooperation of several ministries, corporations, and experts. In addition, the government must commit time and money to assure success. Controlling the nuclear fuel cycle preserves the energy security of our nation and prevents any other state from being able to stop the process of nuclear energy production."
 SWE_USA_NUK.1.d:0 "The Swedish government has offered to purchase nuclear weapons from us. The Swedes cite the escalating Soviet threat to its border and a need to defend itself from nuclear blackmail in the future. The Pentagon and State Department note a hypothetical loss of Sweden due to a Soviet invasion would expose the northern flank of NATIO and risk giving the Soviets the advantage. Nuclear weapons would likely secure Sweden a deterrence and there is little risk of the country falling to the Soviet orbit. However, officials caution that selling these weapons would make future efforts to promote non-proliferation moot." 
 SWE_USA_NUK.2.d:0 "The United States agreed to supply us with nuclear weapons. This is a landmark achievement for the government and secures a nuclear deterrent for the nation. Our own experts predicting achieving such capabilities were years away. Our own systems, especially delivery systems are already based on American technology so building robust delivery mechanisms does not appear too challenging. The Defense Ministry and military leadership are planning on meeting soon to plan the deployment and maintenance of the weapons."
 SWE_USA_NUK.3.d:0 "The United States refused to supply us with nuclear weapons. It appears they could not accept such a deal as it ran contrary to their international stance on nuclear proliferation and responsibility. Even if the agreement was kept secret, its discovery would leave the Americans exposed domestically and internationally. Despite its rejection, the United States did express an understanding the challenges facing the Swedish nation. The government must consider its options, including accelerating our domestic program in order to a chieve rapid nuclearization."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.1.d:0 "The people of Sweden are going to polling stations to vote in the 1952 General Elections. The Swedish Social Democratic Party will look to remain in power. It hopes the vision of class collaboration for the national good and its push to pursue the middle path between socialism and capitalism remains attractive to voters. There are several center right and conservative parties vying for seats as well. They are hoping to receive enough votes to form a coalition and move Sweden towards a free market economy, and closer to the west. The election is expected to be tightly contested."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.2.d:0 "Elections are being held across Sweden for the 1956 General Elections. The Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) hopes its vision for establishing Sweden as a "peoples home" resonates with voters, along with their advocation for class collaboration. The center right and right wing parties hope to persuade Swedes to embrace a more free market economy, warning the SAP promotes taxes and regulations that cripples economic growth. Analysts are unsure which party is likely to carry the day."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.3.d:0 "There is an excited atmosphere across Sweden as millions take to the polls to vote in the 1958 General Elections. The Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) hopes its vision for establishing Sweden as a "peoples home" resonates with voters, along with their advocation for class collaboration. However, it must maintain unity between its more leftist faction and the moderate faction within the party. The center right and right-wing parties hope to persuade Swedes to embrace a more free market economy, warning the SAP promotes taxes and regulations that cripples economic growth. Both sides will look for a dominating electoral victory to effectively implement their legislative agenda." 
 add_1_billion:0 "Add 1 Billion Dollars"
 SWE_NATO.5.d:0 "NATO announced the admission of Sweden as its newest member. This is a major gain for the organization as considering the economic, military, and strategic value of the state. The Swedish government released a statement expressing its joy for working with nations deeply committed to democratic ideals and cooperation. A senior delegation of Swedish economic and defense officials are expected to meet with NATO leaders in the coming weeks. The announcement has led to anxiety in Europe over how the Soviet Union may react. The Soviets had often warned shift of Swedish neutrality would require response."
 SWE_NATO.6.d:0 "NATO members are meeting in an emergency summit following news that Soviet forces seized control of the Norwegian island of Svalbard. The strategic island, home to mostly Soviet settlers who work the mines has long been an area of dispute between the Soviet Union and Norway. The Soviets claim it seized the island to prevent NATO from occupying or militarizing it, in violation to the Soviet interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty. With the treaty violated, the Soviets argued it had to act. Many are linking the Soviet action to Sweden joining NATO. The Soviets believe a hostile Sweden and a NATO presence in Svalbard would put Soviet shipping in unacceptable danger."
 SWE_Non_Prolif.1.d:0 "The Swedish government called on all nations to embrace nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. In a statement, the Swedish government noted the spread of nuclear weapons represents a fundamental challenge to global security and the future of humanity itself. Sweden from henceforth will endeavor to support efforts at reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons and the spread of such weapons across the globe."
 SWE_Nukes.201.d:0 "The debate of a nuclear arms program ended with a decision by the Swedish government to end efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. It appears the pressure from pacifists within the government carried the day. In addition, the estimated costs of a nuclear program were proving too much and many in the government felt such funds could be better used to support welfare programs or to meet other, more pressing defense needs. Although Sweden will no longer pursue a nuclear weapons program, efforts at harnessing nuclear energy are expected to continue."
 OB_54.1.d:0 "Public debate has emerged following the release of a report titled OB-54 by General Nils Swedlund, the commander of all Swedish forces. The report states the only way to guarantee the safety and independence of Sweden was through the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Almost all political parties are taking a stance on the issue, with pro and anti nuclear weapon factions forming in the larger parties. Those who support the report note Sweden is in the frontline of the global nuclear powers and to not have such weapons puts the nation at extraordinary risk. Opponents fear nuclear weapons would only attract more foreign threats and give the military too much power. Regardless, it appears the military has made its position known on the topic."
 SWE_NUCLEAR.10.d:0 "Sweden recently established the Department of Nuclear Physics to explore issues related to developing nuclear energy. However, it is clear from recent policy debates and domestic projects being carried out, that the department may also be conducting research on a nuclear weapons program for the country. There is increasing public uproar in opposition to acquiring such weapons, but the military continues to insist these weapons are the only way to save Sweden. The government could take this opportunity to embrace no nuclear program and firmly establish the recent developments are for a nuclear energy program."
 SWE_Nukes.100.d:0 "Sweden declared its intention to continue with a nuclear weapons program despite growing public anger towards the program. Opponents claim the weapons go against the pacifist nature of Sweden and greatly enhances the military. The government notes that it too would happily not have such a program or a large military, but the international situation demands Sweden acquire the bomb. If anything, the last war and its impact on Europe shows no nation can be complacent. The United States and Soviet Union have both expressed alarm at these recent developments."
 SWE_Nukes.200.d:0 "The Swedish government announced it would no longer pursue a nuclear weapons program and was dismantling the program. All elements relevant to peaceful nuclear energy development will be transferred out. This is a major victory for denuclearization elements, especially the National Federation of Social Democratic Women in Sweden which took the lead on the issue and brought greater public awareness to the debate. The military and more conservative elements are likely to be disappointed by this result."
 SWE_USA_NUK.4.d:0 "The United States confirmed the sale and transfer of nuclear weapons to Sweden. The United States noted that Sweden is a frontline state, facing overwhelming threats to its independence and sovereignty. The weapons provided will provide Sweden a safe deterrence and secure the freedom of its people. The Swedish government similarly noted the weapons will protect the people and reduce the threat of open conflict. The Soviet Union and even allied sates have reacted negatively to the news, claiming the Americans were supporting the proliferation of nuclear weapons internationally."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.10.d:0 "The Swedish Social Democrat Party (SAP) continued its electoral success by winning the largest number of seats in the recent elections. It is expected to form a coalition with other left leaning parties, including the Farmers League. The party likens its victory to a confirmation that Swedes embrace the vision of the nation as a "peoples house" with all its citizens working together for its growth. The SAP has dominated general elections since the 1920s and its victory was not a complete shock, though the opposition managed to gain a few more seats."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.11.d:0 "The Swedish Social Democrat Party (SAP) won the largest number of seats in the recent elections. It is expected to form a coalition with other left leaning parties, including the centrist Farmers League. The party likens its victory to a confirmation that Swedes embrace the vision of the nation as a "peoples house" with all its citizens working together for its growth. The SAP victory is one among many the party has achieved since the 1920s. Although the coalition appears stable, there are reports some partners are concerned over some of the new welfare programs being proposed."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.12.d:0 "The Swedish Social Democrat Party (SAP) achieved a major victory in the recent election by winning the largest number of seats. It is expected to form a coalition with other left leaning parties, including, potentially the centrist Farmers League. The party likens its victory to a confirmation that Swedes embrace the vision of the nation as a "peoples house" with all its citizens working together for its growth. The SAP victory is one among many the party has achieved since the 1920s. The party leaders emphasized its victory shows the desire of Swedes to live in peace and unity, not in ideological strife."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.13.d:0 "A coalition of right leaning parties, including Conservative Party and Liberal Peoples Party have formed a new government in Sweden. This ends decades of political domination by the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP). The coalition is being called a coalition of the bourgeois. The new ruling coalition was quick to assert its victory reflects a desire by Swedes who want rapid economic growth through free market policies. The coalition also promises to strengthen the military and more closely align Sweden to the West."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.14.d:0 "A coalition of right leaning parties, including Conservative Party and Liberal Peoples Party have formed a new government in Sweden. This is a blow for the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) which has a long history of electoral success since the 1920s. The coalition is being called a coalition of the bourgeois. The new ruling coalition asserts its victory reflects a desire by Swedes who want rapid economic growth through free market policies. The coalition also promises to strengthen the military and more closely align Sweden to the West."
 SWE_ELECTIONS.15.d:0 "A coalition of right leaning parties, including Conservative Party and Liberal Peoples Party have formed a new government in Sweden. This is a blow for the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) which has a long history of electoral success since the 1920s. The coalition is being called a coalition of the bourgeois. The new ruling coalition asserts its victory reflects a desire by Swedes who want rapid economic growth through free market policies. The coalition also promises to strengthen the military and more closely align Sweden to the West. Analysts believe anxiety over Soviet threats provided a major boost for the right leaning parties who all advocate for a strong defense."
